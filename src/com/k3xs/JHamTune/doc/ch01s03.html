a selection of frequencies from the Main Window, an S-meter, 
and a slider that sets a virtual squelch level.  </p><p>
JHamTune listens on each frequency in turn looking for a signal that exceeds the 
squelch level, and when it finds one it stays tuned to that frequency until 
either the signal drops or the channel is locked out with a single mouse click.
When a channel breaks squelch, the button title turns bright red. 
When the scan resumes, each time that channel is found to be quiet, the red 
color is slightly darkened. By observing the relative colors, you can 
judge which channels have been the most active recently.</p><p>
A single mouse click will remove a channel temporarily from the scan, useful 
when the frequency is busy but not currently of interest. 
These "locked-out" channels show a darker background. 
</p><p>
You can force the scanner to listen to one channel with a double mouse click; 
the button will turn white, that frequency and mode will be tuned,
and scanning will stop. To resume scanning, click
on the locked channel once; scanning will resume and the channel will be locked 
out of the scan. To return the locked-out channel to the scan click on it again
