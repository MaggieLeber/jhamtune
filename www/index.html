<h2>JHamTune, a control program for Amateur Radio Stations</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
JHamTune is a Java-based system for controlling amateur radio stations. 
It operates in Linux, Mac OSX and Windows environments. 
</p>
<p>
JHamTune defines a Java radio driver interface to make it 
easy to add support for different ham radio equipment. So far we have only 
a driver for Yaesu FT-847 radios, and the function and design of 
the system is still evolving.
We're looking for hams who also know some Java 
to develop and test new drivers. 
We're also interested in recruiting beta testers.</p>
<p>
Contact Maggie at k3xs@arrl.net if your're interested in 
participating in the project as a developer or beta tester.</p>
