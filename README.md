<h2>JHamTune, a control program for Amateur Radio Stations</h2>
 
JHamTune is a Java-based system for controlling amateur radio stations. 
It operates in Linux, Mac OSX and Windows environments. 
 
JHamTune defines a Java radio driver interface to make it 
easy to add support for different ham radio equipment. So far we have only 
a driver for Yaesu FT-847 radios, and the function and design of 
the system is still evolving.
